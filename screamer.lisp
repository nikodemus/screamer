This affects only side effects introduced explicitly via SETF and SETQ. Side
effects introduced by either user defined functions or builtin Common Lisp
functions such as RPLACA are always global.

Behaviour of side effects introduced by macro-expansions such as INCF depends
on the exact macro-expansion. If (INCF (FOO)) expands using eg. SET-FOO, LOCAL
is unable to undo the side-effect.

LOCAL cannot distinguish between initially uninitialized and intialized
places, such as unbound variables or hash-table keys with no prior values. As
a result, an attempt to assign an unbound variable inside LOCAL will signal an
error due to the system's attempt to first read the variable. Similarly,
undoing a (SETF GETHASH) when the key did not previously exist in the table
will insert a NIL into the table instead of doing a REMHASH. Easiest way
to work around this is by using TRAIL.

LOCAL and GLOBAL may be nested inside one another. The nearest lexically
surrounding one determines whether or not a given SETF or SETQ results in a
local or global side effect.

Side effects default to be global when there is no surrounding LOCAL or GLOBAL
expression. Local side effects can appear both in deterministic as well as
nondeterministic contexts though different techniques are used to implement
the trailing of prior values for restoration upon backtracking. In
nondeterministic contexts, LOCAL as well as SETF are treated as special forms

If X is an unbound variable then it must be known to have a countable set of

The dereferenced value of X is then returned.

An unbound variable is known to have a countable set of potential values
either if it is known to have a finite domain or if it is known to be integer
valued.

An error is signalled if X is not known to have a finite domain and is not

Upon backtracking X will be bound to each potential value in turn, failing
when there remain no untried alternatives.

Since the set of potential values is required only to be countable, not
finite, the set of untried alternatives may never be exhausted and
backtracking need not terminate. This can happen, for instance, when X is
known to be an integer but lacks either an upper of lower bound.

The ordering force function which is returned is a nondeterministic function

each value may be either a variable or a non-variable. The ordering force
function applies the FORCE-FUNCTION in turn to each of the variables in X, in
the order that they appear, repeatedly applying the FORCE-FUNCTION to a given
variable until it becomes bound before proceeding to the next variable. The
ordering force function does not return any meaningful result.

FORCE-FUNCTION is any (potentially nondeterministic) function which can be
applied to a variable as its single argument with the stipulation that a
finite number of repeated applications will force the variable to be bound.

EQUALV is called.

The values of X, Y and V are mutually constraints via noticers so that V
equals T if and only if X is known to equal Y and V equals NIL if and only if
X is known not to equal Y.

Noticers are attached to V as well as to all variables nested in both in X and
Y. When the noticers attached to variables nested in X and Y detect that X is
known to equal Y they restrict V to equal T. Likewise, when the noticers
attached to variables nested in X and Y detect that X is known not to equal Y
they restrict V to equal NIL.

Furthermore, if V later becomes known to equal T then X and Y are unified.
Likewise, if V later becomes known to equal NIL then X and Y are restricted to
not be equal. This is accomplished by attaching noticers to the variables
nested in X and Y which detect when X becomes equal to Y and fail.

The expression \(KNOWN? (EQUALV X Y)) is analogous to the extra-logical predicate
`==' typically available in Prolog.

The expression \(KNOWN? (NOTV (EQUALV X Y))) is analogous to the extra-logical
predicate `\\=' typically available in Prolog.

disunification operator available in Prolog-II."

  "Returns a boolean value which is constrained to be T if all of the
arguments are numerically equal, and constrained to be NIL if two or more of
the arguments numerically differ.

This function takes one or more arguments. All of the arguments are restricted
to be numeric.

Returns T when called with one argument. A call such as \(=V X1 X2 ... Xn)
with more than two arguments behaves like a conjunction of two argument calls:

  \(ANDV (=V X1 X2) ... (=V Xi Xi+1) ... (=V Xn-1 Xn))

When called with two arguments, returns T if X1 is known to be equal to X2 at
the time of call, NIL if X1 is known not to be equal to X2 at the time of
call, and a new boolean variable V if is not known if the two values are
equal.

Two numeric values are known to be equal only when they are both bound and
equal according to the Common Lisp function =.

Two numeric values are known not to be equal when their domains are disjoint.
Furthermore, two real values are known not to be equal when their ranges are
disjoint, i.e. the upper bound of one is greater than the lower bound of the
other.

When a new variable is created, the values of X1, X2, and V are mutually
constrained via noticers so that V is equal to T if and only if X1 is known to
be equal to X2, and V is equal to NIL if and only if X1 is known not to be
equal to X2.

* If it later becomes known that X1 is equal to X2 noticers attached to X1 and
  X2 restrict V to equal T. Likewise if it later becomes known that X1 is not
  equal to X2 noticers attached to X1 and X2 restrict V to equal NIL.

* If V ever becomes known to equal T then a noticer attached to V restricts X1
  to be equal to X2. Likewise if V ever becomes known to equal NIL then a
  noticer attached to V restricts X1 not to be equal to X2.

* If X1 is known to be real then the noticer attached to X2 continually
  restrict the upper bound of X1 to be no higher than the upper bound of X2
  and the lower bound of X1 to be no lower than the lower bound of X2.
  Likewise for bounds of X1 if X2 is known to be real.

Restricting two values x1 and x2 to be equal is performed by attaching
noticers to x1 and x2. These noticers continually restrict the domains of x1
and x2 to be equivalent sets (using the Common Lisp function = as a test
function) as their domains are restricted.

Restricting two values X1 and X2 to not be equal is also performed by
attaching noticers to X1 and X2. These noticers however do not restrict the
domains or ranges of X1 or X2. They simply monitor their continually
restrictions and fail when any assertion causes X1 to be known to be equal to
X2."

Returns T when called with one argument. A call such as \(<V X1 X2 ... Xn)
with more than two arguments behaves like a conjunction of two argument calls:

When called with two arguments, returns T if X1 is known to be less than X2 at
the time of call, NIL if X1 is known to be greater than or equal to X2 at the
time of call, and otherwise a new boolean variable V.

A real value X1 is known to be less than a real value X2 if X1 has an upper
bound, X2 has a lower bound and the upper bound of X1 is less than the lower
bound of X2.

A real value X1 is known to be greater than or equal to a real value X2 if X1
has a lower bound, X2 has an upper bound and the lower bound of X1 is greater
than or equal to the upper bound of X2.

When a new variable is created, the values of X1, X2 and v are mutually

Restricting a real value X1 to be less than a real value X2 is performed by
attaching noticers to X1 and X2. The noticer attached to X1 continually
restricts the lower bound of X2 to be no lower than the upper bound of X1 if
X1 has an upper bound. The noticer attached to X2 continually restricts the
upper bound of X1 to be no higher than the lower bound of X2 if X2 has a lower
bound. Since these restrictions only guarantee that X1 be less than or equal
to X2, the constraint that X1 be strictly less than X2 is enforced by having
the noticers fail when both X1 and X2 become known to be equal.

Restricting a real value X1 to be greater than or equal to a real value X2 is
performed by an analogous set of noticers without this last equality check."

  "Restricts X to be a boolean. If X is equal to T after being restricted to

The initial restriction to boolean may cause other assertions to be made due
to noticers attached to X. A call to KNOWN? fails if X is known not to be

value. Otherwise implements a single binary-branching step of a
divide-and-conquer search algorithm. There are always two alternatives, the
second of which is tried upon backtracking.

If it is known to have a finite domain D then this domain is split into two
halves and the value of X is nondeterministically restricted to be a member
one of the halves. If X becomes bound by this restriction then its value is
returned. Otherwise, X itself is returned.

If X is not known to have a finite domain but is known to be real and to have
both lower and upper bounds then nondeterministically either the lower or
upper bound is restricted to the midpoint between the lower and upper bound.
If X becomes bound by this restriction then its dereferenced value is
returned. Otherwise, X itself is returned.

An error is signalled if X is not known to be restricted to a finite domain
and either is not known to be real or is not known to have both a lower and
upper bound.

When the set of potential values may be infinite, users of
DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER-FORCE may need to take care to fail when the range size of
the variable becomes too small, unless other constraints on it are sufficient
to guarentee failure.

The method of splitting the domain into two halves is left unspecified to give
future implementations leeway in incorporating heuristics in the process of
determining a good search order. All that is specified is that if the domain
size is even prior to splitting, the halves are of equal size, while if the

The FORCE-FUNCTION is any (potentially nondeterministic) function

the variable to be bound. The FORCE-FUNCTION need not return any useful value.

The ordering force function which is returned is a nondeterministic function
which takes a single argument X. This argument X can be a list of values where
each value may be either a variable or a non-variable.

The ordering force function repeatedly selects a \"best\" variable using using
COST-FUNCTION and ORDER. Eg. using #'DOMAIN-SIZE and #'< as the COST-FUNCTION
and ORDER, then the variable with the smallest domain will be forced first.

Function TERMINATE? is then called with the determined cost of that variable,
and unless it returns true, FORCE-FUNCTION is applied to that variable to
force constrain it.

Process then iterates until all variables become bound or TERMINATE? returns
true.

The ordering force function does not return any meaningful result.

may provide additional ones. \(The defined Screamer protocol does not provide
