;;;; There are five houses in a row, each of different color.

;;;; Each has an owner of a different nationality.

;;;; Each owner has a unique favorite drink, type of cigarette, and a pet.

;;;;    1. The Brit lives in the red house
;;;;    2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets
;;;;    3. The Dane drinks tea
;;;;    4. The green house is on the left of the white house
;;;;    5. The green house's owner drinks coffee
;;;;    6. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds
;;;;    7. The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill
;;;;    8. The man living in the centre house drinks milk
;;;;    9. The Norwegian lives in the first house
;;;;   10. The person who smokes Marlboro lives next to the one who keeps cats
;;;;   11. The person who keeps horses lives next to the person who smokes Dunhill
;;;;   12. The person who smokes Winfield drinks beer
;;;;   13. The German smokes Rothmans
;;;;   14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house
;;;;   15. The person who smokes Marlboro has a neigbor who drinks water

;;;; Question: Who owns the fish?
