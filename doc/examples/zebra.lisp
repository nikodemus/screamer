;;;; Example: "The Zebra Puzzle"
;;;;
;;;; Classic riddle popularly attributed to Lewis Carrol. (Essentially the
;;;; same as "The Einstein's Riddle".)
;;;;
;;;; This solution, contributed by Stephan Frank, uses the constraint
;;;; propagation features of Screamer.
;;;;
;;;; Five men with different nationalities live in the first five houses of a
;;;; street. They practise five distinct professions, and each of them has a
;;;; favourite animal and a favourite drink, all of them different. The five
;;;; houses are painted in different colours.
;;;;
;;;;    1. The Englishman lives in a red house.
;;;;    2. The Spaniard owns a dog.
;;;;    3. The Japanese is a painter.
;;;;    4. The Italian drinks tea.
;;;;    5. The Norwegian lives in the first house on the left.
;;;;    6. The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
;;;;    7. The green house is on the right of the white one.
;;;;    8. The sculptor breeds snails.
;;;;    9. The diplomat lives in the yellow house.
;;;;   10. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
;;;;   11. The Norwegian's house is next to the blue one.
;;;;   12. The violinist drinks fruit juice.
;;;;   13. The fox is in a house next to that of the doctor.
;;;;   14. The horse is in a house next to that of the diplomat.
;;;;
;;;; Question: Who owns a Zebra, and who drinks water?

;;;; Constraint model
;;;;
;;;; Houses are identified by integers from 1 to 5.
;;;;
;;;; We first bind logic variables taking values in that range in
;;;; LET-INTEGERS-BETWEEN for all properties. We group them and assert that
;;;; every value is unique in its group using ALL-DIFFERENTV.
;;;;
;;;; We create three mode logic variables to represent distances between
;;;; certain houses.
;;;;
;;;; We assert the constraints stated in the riddle.
;;;;
;;;; Finally, we ask Screamer to provide a solution that satisfies
;;;; all given constraints.
