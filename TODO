** TODO =v and ==v don't always propagate correctly
Sometimes variables linked to solution variables by these operators don't have an effect unless they're included in the output of the relevant ~solution~ form. For instance, in the following code:
#+begin_src lisp
(let ((*maximum-discretization-range* 20))
     (with-trail nil
       (time
        (identity
         (let ((a (an-integer-betweenv 1 4))
               (b (an-integer-betweenv 1 4))
               (c (an-integer-betweenv 1 4)))
           (identity
            (let* ((l1 (list a b c))
                   (ans (an-integer-betweenv 0 7)))
              ; (assert! (all-differentv l1))
              (assert! (/=v a b))
              (assert! (/=v b c))
              (assert! (/=v a c))
              ; (assert! (<v a b c))
              (assert! (=v ans (+v a b c)))
              (print ans)
              (print (list a b c))
              (all-values
                (solution (list ans a) (reorder #'domain-size #l((declare (ignore %)) nil) #'< #'linear-force))))))))))
#+end_src
We get the output ~((6 1) (7 1) (6 2) (7 2) (6 3) (7 4))~

But in the following code:
#+begin_src lisp
(let ((*maximum-discretization-range* 20))
     (with-trail nil
       (time
        (identity
         (let ((a (an-integer-betweenv 1 4))
               (b (an-integer-betweenv 1 4))
               (c (an-integer-betweenv 1 4)))
           (identity
            (let* ((l1 (list a b c))
                   (ans (an-integer-betweenv 0 7)))
              ; (assert! (all-differentv l1))
              (assert! (/=v a b))
              (assert! (/=v b c))
              (assert! (/=v a c))
              ; (assert! (<v a b c))
              (assert! (=v ans (+v a b c)))
              (print ans)
              (print (list a b c))
              (all-values
                (solution (list ans) (reorder #'domain-size #l((declare (ignore %)) nil) #'< #'linear-force))))))))))
#+end_src
We instead get the output ~((4) (5) (6) (7))~, which ignores the difference constraints on the elements of the list.
** TODO LOCAL only reliable with explicit SETF/SETQ:
    If (INCF (FOO)) expands into a form that does SET-FOO instead of
    (SETF (FOO) ...) form, the code walker will not know about the
    side-effect.

    Options:
    - Implement SCREAMER:INCF, etc.
      - This seems a good approach; there is a well-defined set of functions we could reimplement to get complete coverage.
    - Add advice on some relevant generic function to get notified when these kinds of replacements are made, and store the new function as an equivalent of ~incf~ / ~setf~ / etc.?
    - Wrap all non-SETF/SETQ forms in GLOBAL, so that those side-effects are never undone?
    - Leave it as-is?
      - This feels like a bad option; it leads users who care more about runtime performance (and are thus more likely to be power users who also need greater reliability) to lose program correctness.
* Old "Bugs to fix" list from screamer.lisp
  These haven't been verified or anything, just moved here.
*** TODO Deterministic/nondeterministic LOCAL SETF/SETQ undone out of order.
*** TODO Changing determinism status can cause code from a different file to be included causing weird behavior.
*** TODO May loop when expressions contain circular lists.
*** DONE APPLY-NONDETERMINISTIC conses.
* WIP Complete manual
***** DONE All exported symbols documented.
***** WIP Cleanups
******* DONE Some docstrings talk of EXPRESSIONS, some of FORMS.
******* DONE "Yields" vs "returns" a value.
******* TODO Restricts vs constrains.
******* TODO Don't talk about noticers: they're an implementation detail.
***** TODO Simplify the language in the constraint section.
* TODO Make iscream.el work under Slime.
* [-] Dynamic-extent in CPS-CONVERT-TAGBODY?
We have a straightforward approach (around line 1983), need to check if it works.
* [-] Split the system into logical pieces.
    Most of the DEFUN-COMPILE-TIME functions should probably go
    to a file of their own, loaded before the main screamer code
    is compiled.
* TODO Cleanups
*** TODO #:DUMMY-N gensyms used all over the place
    This makes macro-expansions harder to read than they need to be.
    Use differently named gensyms for different things.
*** TODO DEFMACRO-COMPILE-TIME
      Check if Allegro still needs this.
*** TODO primordial.lisp has some commented-out tests using LOOP
    Apparently LOCAL and LOOP interactions depend on the specific
    expansion of loop. :/ If nothing else, documentation should
    mention this. An alternative would be to provide our own
    implemntation of LOOP that is well-behaved when it comes to LOCAL.
*** TODO review the remaining limitations listed in the old source, and put the in the manual
     1. Does not handle SETF methods with multiple values for LOCAL
        SETF.
     2. If you do a (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'FOO) ...) to a nondeterministic
	function you will lose when you attempt to evaluate (FOO ...).
     3. If you do a (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'FOO) ...) to a deterministic
	function when FOO was previously defined as a nondeterministic
	function you will lose when you attempt to evaluate (FOO ...).
     4. The function record table will not work if we ever support FLET and
	 LABELS and in particular, if we ever support FLET and LABELS of
	  nondeterministic functions.
     5. There is no way to force Screamer into compiling a deterministic
	function as a nondeterministic one. A wizard might want to do this to
	take advantage of the fact that a LOCAL SETF/SETQ in a nondeterministic
	function does not cons up closures.
* Old "TTMTTD" list from screamer.lisp
  Things to Maybe Think Then Do? *shrug*
*** TODO Should have way of having a stream of values.
*** TODO Kashket's constraint additions Fall90-158.
*** TODO Compress trail after repeated LOCAL SETF/SETQ to same variable
*** TODO LOCAL SETF/SETQ on symbol can use special variable binding stack instead of unwind-protect.
*** TODO (F (G (H (EITHER X Y)))) where F, G and H are deterministic can
    CPS-CONVERT to (FUNCALL #'(LAMBDA (Z) (F (G (H Z)))) (EITHER X Y)).
*** TODO Should give warning when it recompiles functions due to changing determinism status.
*** TODO =V <V <=V >V and >=V should do congruence/monotone closure.
*** TODO =V should propagate domains.
*** TODO BEST-VALUE
*** TODO Should cache VARIABLE-LOWER-BOUND/VARIABLE-UPPER-BOUND for domain variables.
*** TODO Faster version of BIND! which doesn't cons.
*** TODO Get DIAGNOSIS and MONTAGUE to work.
*** TODO Get GROW-UP and NONLINEAR examples to work.
*** TODO FUNCALLV and APPLYV need to assert the domains of the variable that they return.
*** TODO Check that +V, -V, *V, /V, MINV and MAXV work and do the right thing with type propagation.
*** TODO Check that PROPAGATE does the right thing with bounds of integers.
*** TODO Backtracking out of INTEGER-BETWEENV and the like will yield an unconstrained variable since the constraints are asserted locally.
*** DONE MEMBERV and derivatives should support vectors.
This seems to be resolved by a prior commit
* Refactoring
*** Depend on Alexandria
***** peal-off-documentation-string-and-declarations -> alexandria:parse-body
*** SETF and SETQ walking is suspiciously different
* Future Work
*** TODO See if it would make sense to make nondeterministic functions funcallable instances.
*** [?] Lock package on SBCL?
Why was this a todo?
