* Battle Plan
*** Release 3.21: unofficial maintenance release of 3.20.
***** This is currently happening on "master".
***** WIP Complete manual
      All exported symbols documented, not everything needs to be
      super-polished, but the information should be there.
***** DONE ANSI cleanups
***** Obvious bugfixes, like 19c3bfaadbbf01401db14589c70b2b102297aef0
*** New development
***** Once 3.21 is out, move it onto "classic" branch, into deep maintenance mode.
***** New stuff appears for now on "future" branch, which is rebased constantly.
      It is master + new code on top.
      Once 3.21 is out, future becomes the new master.
***** New stuff is also on "dev" branch, which is not rebased -- for convenience.
      It gets master and future merged into it. Or possibly master as
      merges and future as cherries. In either case, it will be thrown
      out once 3.21 is out.
***** Release 4.0
******* DONE /=V allowing integer bounds to be constrained.
******* Support at least some of the currently missing special forms
******* Add DEFINE-SCREAMER-FUNCTION or similar as an alias to SCREAMER::DEFUN.
******* Identify some performance issues and see if anything can be done.
******* Try to improve debuggability of Screamer generated code.
******* Make iscream.el work under Slime.
******* Change COUNT-FAILURES to make the number easier to access.
* Documentation
*** WIP A web-friendly manual
***** Unify language
******* Some docstrings talk of EXPRESSIONS, some of FORMS.
******* "Yields" vs "returns" a value.
***** Still missing exported symbols:
******* <=v
******* >v
******* >=v
******* count-trues
******* count-truesv
******* +v
******* -v
******* *v
******* /v
******* minv
******* maxv
******* apply-substitution
******* linear-force
******* divide-and-conquer-force
******* static-ordering
******* domain-size
******* range-size
******* reorder
******* solution
******* best-value
******* template
******* define-screamer-package
* Performance
*** TODO Rewrite dynamic-extent continuations using FLET
    At least SBCL cannot currently stack-allocate a let-bound lambda,
    but manages FLET and LABELS just fine.
*** TODO Dynamic-extent in CPS-CONVERT-TAGBODY.
* Maintenance
*** WIP Split the system into logical pieces.
    Most of the DEFUN-COMPILE-TIME functions should probably go
    to a file of their own, loaded before the main screamer code
    is compiled.
*** TODO Cleanups
***** TODO #:DUMMY-N gensyms used all over the place
      This makes macro-expansions harder to read than they need to be.
      Use differently named gensyms for different things.
***** TODO DEFMACRO-COMPILE-TIME
      Check if Allegro still needs this.
*** TODO primordial.lisp has some commented-out tests using LOOP
    Apparently LOCAL and LOOP interactions depend on the specific
    expansion of loop. :/ If nothing else, documentation should
    mention this. An alternative would be to provide our own
    implemntation of LOOP that is well-behaved when it comes to LOCAL.
*** TODO review the remaining limitations listed in the old source, and put the in the manual
     1. Does not handle SETF methods with multiple values for LOCAL
        SETF.
     2. If you do a (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'FOO) ...) to a nondeterministic
	function you will lose when you attempt to evaluate (FOO ...).
     3. If you do a (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION 'FOO) ...) to a deterministic
	function when FOO was previously defined as a nondeterministic
	function you will lose when you attempt to evaluate (FOO ...).
     4. The function record table will not work if we ever support FLET and
	 LABELS and in particular, if we ever support FLET and LABELS of
	  nondeterministic functions.
     5. There is no way to force Screamer into compiling a deterministic
	function as a nondeterministic one. A wizard might want to do this to
	take advantage of the fact that a LOCAL SETF/SETQ in a nondeterministic
	function does not cons up closures.
* Bugs
*** TODO LOCAL only reliable with explicit SETF/SETQ:
    If (INCF (FOO)) expands into a form that does SET-FOO instead of
    (SETF (FOO) ...) form, the code walker will not know about the
    side-effect.

    Options:
    - Implement SCREAMER:INCF, etc.
    - Wrap all non-SETF/SETQ forms in GLOBAL, so that those side-effects are never undone.
    - Leave it as-is.
*** TODO No Previous value vs New Value distinction
***** TODO (SETF (GETHASH ...) ...) does not REMHASH on unwind if there was not previous element
***** TODO LOCAL (SETF/SETQ X e) will signal an error if X is unbound
      because it needs to trail the previous value of X and it has none.
* Old "Bugs to fix" list from screamer.lisp
  These haven't been verified or anything, just moved here.
*** TODO Deterministic/nondeterministic LOCAL SETF/SETQ undone out of order.
*** TODO Changing determinism status
    can cause code from a different file to be included causing wierd behavior.
*** TODO Will signal an obscure error if FAIL is called in a deterministic
    context which is not nested in a choice point.
*** TODO May loop when expressions contain circular lists.
*** TODO APPLY-NONDETERMINISTIC conses.
* Old "TTMTTD" list from screamer.lisp
  Things to Maybe Think Then Do? *shrug*
*** WIP Manual.
*** TODO Should have way of having a stream of values.
*** TODO Kashket's constraint additions Fall90-158.
*** TODO Compress trail after repeated LOCAL SETF/SETQ to same variable
*** TODO LOCAL SETF/SETQ on symbol can use special variable binding stack instead of unwind-protect.
*** TODO (F (G (H (EITHER X Y)))) where F, G and H are deterministic can
    CPS-CONVERT to (FUNCALL #'(LAMBDA (Z) (F (G (H Z)))) (EITHER X Y)).
*** TODO Should give warning when it recompiles functions due to changing determinism status.
*** TODO =V <V <=V >V and >=V should do congruence/monotone closure.
*** TODO =V should propagate domains.
*** TODO BEST-VALUE
*** TODO Should cache VARIABLE-LOWER-BOUND/VARIABLE-UPPER-BOUND for domain variables.
*** TODO Faster version of BIND! which doesn't cons.
*** TODO Get DIAGNOSIS and MONTAGUE to work.
*** TODO Get GROW-UP and NONLINEAR examples to work.
*** TODO FUNCALLV and APPLYV need to assert the domains of the variable that they return.
*** TODO Check that +V, -V, *V, /V, MINV and MAXV work and do the right thing with type propagation.
*** TODO Check that PROPAGATE does the right thing with bounds of integers.
*** TODO MEMBERV and derivatives should support vectors.
*** TODO Backtracking out of INTEGER-BETWEENV and the like will yield an
    unconstrained variable since the constraints are asserted locally.
* Refactoring
*** Depend on Alexandria
***** peal-off-documentation-string-and-declarations -> alexandria:parse-body
*** SETF and SETQ walking is suspiciously different
* Future Work
*** TODO See if it would make sense to make nondeterministic functions funcallable instances.
*** TODO Lock package on SBCL.
